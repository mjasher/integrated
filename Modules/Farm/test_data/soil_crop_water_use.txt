Total available water in mm per metre of soil depth
Texture Class, Min, Max, Average
Sand, 30, 65, 49
Sandy Loam, 90, 123, 106
Loam, 155, 172, 164
Light Clay Loam, 172, 180, 172
Clay Loam, 155, 172, 164
Heavy Clay Loam, 137, 155, 147

For example, if the RAW for clay loam soil is set to be 80 mm of water (50% of total available), 
irrigation would be needed as soon as that amount is used. Note that the amount of water to be applied will depend on the depth of the crop's root system (Table 1).
