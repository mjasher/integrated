#Groundwater entitlement is an average of total licence volume / number of licences in Echuca.
#Average across entire lower Campaspe is ~407ML

#Other 
#Bore Construction fee: $1440
#Replacement bore: $900
#Each Additional bore: $170
#licence amendment: $527 (alter number of bores, alter depth of bore, change bore site)

#Groundwater entitlement calculated by assuming 2 bores per licence
#Total licence volume in lower Campaspe: 55870.4
#Total Number of licences: 138 = 404.85
#  55870.4 / 138 = 405 (rounded up)
#Irrigators used 65% of GW entitlement for reasons unknown

#Entitlement statistics from http://waterregister.vic.gov.au/water-entitlements/entitlement-statistics
#Surface water entitlements calculated by dividing total volume with number of water shares for Zone 4C (Lower Campaspe)
# (high reliability) 1633.5 / 52 = 31.41
# (low reliability) No data

#But this doesn't look right
#DEPI 2014 looks at a case study in which the farmer had 435ML of high reliability water + an unspecified amount of low reliability water
#with trading, the total water use in the case study was a planned 600ML over a 135Ha property
