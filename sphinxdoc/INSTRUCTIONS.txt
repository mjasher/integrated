Create text files to generate HTML documentation:

Edit apidoc.bat with a text editor. Change the directory paths to your apidoc output and source paths.

apidoc.bat

This will create txt files inside the "apidoc" folder.
If you are trying to recreate all txt files, delete the existing txt files first.
Copy the txt files from "documentation/apidoc" to "documentation/source/"

WARNING: DO NOT DELETE/REMOVE THE index.txt FILE FROM documentation/source

Generate HTML documentation:
make html

HTML files should appear in "documentation/html"
