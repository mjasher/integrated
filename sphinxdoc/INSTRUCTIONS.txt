Changes to sphinxdoc configuration can be made in conf.py in the source directory

Sphinxdoc is set to generate diagrams. Graphviz must be installed for this to work.
Get installer from: http://www.graphviz.org/

and do:
conda install graphviz

In conf.py, change "graphviz_dot" variable that points to the dot.exe file
e.g:
  graphviz_dot='c:/PROGRA~2/Graphviz2.38/bin/dot.exe'


Generate HTML documentation:
make_html.bat

HTML files should appear in "documentation/html"
